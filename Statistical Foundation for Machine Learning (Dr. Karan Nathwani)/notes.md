-----------------------------

- Unit Vector 

    - A vector with Unit Norm 

- Orthogonal Vectors 

    - A vector X and a vector y are orthogonal to each other 


- Orthonormal Vectors

    - Vectors are orthogonal and have unit norm 
    
    - Orthogonal Matrix 
        - A square matrix whose rows are mutually orthogonal 


- Matrix Decomposition 

    - Matrices can be decomposed into factors to learn universal propertiers 
        - Just like integers
            - Decomposition of integer

            - Decomposition of matrix
