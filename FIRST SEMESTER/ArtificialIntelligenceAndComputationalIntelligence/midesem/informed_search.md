here is the solution i found on internet

Step-1
----------------
The goal state has 6 classrooms, 3 hotels, 1 residence, and 6 labs, while the current state has 3 classrooms, 2 hotels, 0 residences, and 3 labs.

 If you have the cost of each of these components, you can calculate the difference by subtracting the cost of the current state from the cost of the goal state.

Step-2
----------------
For example, if the cost of a classroom is 5 lakhs, the cost of a hotel is 18 lakhs, the cost of a residence is 30 lakhs, and the cost of a lab is 6 lakhs, then the cost of the goal state would be:

6 classrooms * 5 lakhs/classroom + 3 hotels * 18 lakhs/hotel + 1 residence * 30 lakhs + 6 labs * 6 lakhs/lab
= 30 lakhs + 54 lakhs + 30 lakhs + 36 lakhs
= 150 lakhs

Explanationfor step 2
6 classrooms * 5 lakhs/classroom + 3 hotels * 18 lakhs/hotel + 1 residence * 30 lakhs + 6 labs * 6 lakhs/lab

= 30 lakhs + 54 lakhs + 30 lakhs + 36 lakhs

= 150 lakhs

Step-3
--------------------
The cost of the current state would be:
3 classrooms * 5 lakhs/classroom + 2 hotels * 18 lakhs/hotel + 0 residences * 30 lakhs + 3 labs * 6 lakhs/lab
= 15 lakhs + 36 lakhs + 0 lakhs + 18 lakhs
= 69 lakhs

Therefore, the difference between the cost of the goal state and the current state would be 150 lakhs - 69 lakhs 

= 81 lakhs.
Explanationfor step 3
3 classrooms * 5 lakhs/classroom + 2 hotels * 18 lakhs/hotel + 0 residences * 30 lakhs + 3 labs * 6 lakhs/lab

= 15 lakhs + 36 lakhs + 0 lakhs + 18 lakhs

= 69 lakhs

Final Answer
------------------------------
Therefore, the difference between the cost of the goal state and the current state would be 150 lakhs - 69 lakhs = 81 lakhs.
